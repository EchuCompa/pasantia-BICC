Previous Markov chain techniques have yielded algorithms that generate approximately uniform samples. Here, we create a bounding chain for one such Markov chain, and by using a non-Markovian coupling together with a modified form of coupling from the past, we build an algorithm for perfectly generating samples. The expected running time of the procedure is O(n3lnn), making the technique as fast as the mixing time of the Karzanov/Khachiyan chain upon which it is based.}

Abstract
We present two algorithms for computing the number of linear extensions of a given n -element poset. Our first approach builds upon an O(2 nn) -time dynamic programming algorithm by splitting subproblems into connected components and recursing on them independently. The recursion may run over two alternative subproblem spaces, and we provide heuristics for choosing the more efficient one. Our second algorithm is based on variable elimination via inclusion-exclusion and runs in time O(n t+4) , where t is the treewidth of the cover graph. We demonstrate experimentally that these new algorithms outperform previously suggested ones for a wide range of posets, in particular when the posets are sparse.

Consistent posets
Abstract
We introduce so-called consistent posets which are bounded posets with an antitone involution ′ where the lower cones of ��,��′ and of ��,��′ coincide provided that x, y are different from 0, 1 and, moreover, if x, y are different from 0, then their ...

On extensions of ideals in posets
Two kinds of order ideals, namely, the n-prime ideals and k-closed ideals of a poset are introduced and shown to be equivalent in the sense that an order-ideal is (n+1)-prime if and only if it is n-closed. Also a prime radical theorem for these ideals ...

Representability of Kleene Posets and Kleene Lattices
Abstract
A Kleene lattice is a distributive lattice equipped with an antitone involution and satisfying the so-called normality condition. These lattices were introduced by J. A. Kalman. We extended this concept also for posets with an antitone involution. ...
